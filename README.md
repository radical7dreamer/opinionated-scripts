# Airtable Better Workspaces

I have so many tables and workspaces that the default Airtable interface is too distracting. This scriptmonkey:
- Redirects airtable.com to airtable.com/workspaces
- Removes top and left sidebar
- Darkens the background
- Renames the "Workspaces" into something custom (Like "Business OS")
